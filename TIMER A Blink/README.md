# TIMER A Blink
The TIMER peripherals are used in this lab to act as an alternative to polling the outputs every while loop. Using the timers are more efficient as it uses less resources and only activates the processor (if using low power mode) when the interrupt is triggered. In this lab, the Timer is used to trigger an interrupt in the code and toggle a bit. In this case, it is used to toggle and LED on and off.
